This is not a complete in-depth guide. The intention of this post is to quickly get you started on setting up a Spring Cloud environment on the local system.  

The following will be covered here:
- Create 2 instances of hello-world microservice
- Create an Eureka Service, Zuul API Gateway and Config Server
- Setup Spring Cloud Bus to allow config changes
